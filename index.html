<h1>!NEW! Final Forms !MUST COMPLETE!</h1>

<p>Greencastle has implemented a new system called Final Forms. This will help keep track of physicals, dues, signatures and so on.<br />
  Personally I am very excited for this new feature. It will help me in more ways than one with organizing information from the players and parents.<br />
With change comes confusion. Below I have included a step by step guide on how to get your account set up.</p>

<!-- Final Forms Instruction List-->
<ol>
<li>Select the Link to get started --  <a href="https://greencastle-in.finalforms.com/">Final Forms Sign up</a></li>
<li>Choose Parent or Student for the one that applies to you and select "New Account"</li>
